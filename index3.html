  <h2>Method</h2>
  <p>Pick 70g of wild rocket into a pestle and mortar, then bash to a paste with a pinch of sea salt.
Peel and bash in Â½ a clove of garlic, then pound in 50g of unshelled pistachios until fine. Muddle in 4 tablespoons of olive oil, finely grate in 25g of Parmesan, then squeeze in the juice of 1 lemon. Season to perfection with salt and black pepper, then taste and tweak the pesto to your liking.
Cook 300g of dried linguine in a pan of boiling water according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a mugful of starchy cooking water.
Meanwhile, snap off the woody ends from 320g of asparagus.
Toss the pasta with the pesto, then using a speed-peeler, peel lengths of the asparagus into the pan, loosening with a splash of reserved cooking water, if needed.
Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and finish with the remaining 10g of rocket and a fine grating of Parmesan. Delicious served with a crunchy salad.</p>
